1.	 *Weekend Issues Affecting Business:* o	Our night shift agent are not able to see the leads all night. It keeps showing as loading. Does the system upgrade happen in the night? What are the timings? We are told all night they are unable to do much on CRM. We need clarity to understand this.  2.	 *Shuffling Leads Issues:* o	 *We have to shuffle leads 4 times in the day.*  *First at 8am - Second @1pm - Third @ 5pm and Fourth @10pm.*  o	Shuffling leads is a tedious task now. The lead shuffle limit at one go is only 10k and we have more than 1 Lakh 27 Thousand leads currently, imagine shuffling all of these 4 times a day in a batch of 10k each. We are spending more than an hour only in shuffling leads.  Plus everytime we select the 10k leads and start the shuffle we need to choose the names of the agents again and again for every shuffle.  Instead of using name filters repeatedly, we need a single-click option to move leads to the next shift agents or increase the shuffle limit (currently capped at 5K, despite the system stating 50K). *3.	Hourly Report Issues:* o	We want to be able to see the lead flow in hourly basis.  Currently this is possible by manually entering the 1 hour time. And I‚Äôm manually capturing them, despite raising this issue multiple times. o	I have been continuously following-up and everytime I am told we will check with our tech team and get back.   4. Before we had the *Reports tab - leaderboard report working. Currently that page remains blank.*  We are generating reports from the all leads view. Can we have better display of reports so we can fast track our work.  5. We want to automate certain aspects of our lead flow to ensure a more efficient process and minimize the risk of missing potential leads. I had an initial discussion with the tech team (Ramsha) three weeks ago, but it was just a single meeting. To implement this effectively, we need additional discussions where we can explain our business process in detail and set up the necessary template flows. Automating these workflows will help streamline operations and improve lead management. 6. Although the workflow is set, agents who are not part of it are still receiving leads. Why is this happening? We are facing a similar issue with calls, which we have already highlighted to the IVR team. (#AS UG4184 OnRoadz) (05/02/2025, 04:15 pm)
